## List of new CSS feature for me which already works or incomes in the near future

I am very glad that I spent time researching all the new properties and meanings that I did not understand.

New technologies, if not monitored, give a sense of missed opportunities.
New approaches to rendering a page, or inheritance, or new units would have allowed me to do my job faster or solve a very specific problem.

I advise everyone to try to take such a survey and find their gaps, fill them in, and become better.

I am proud of myself!

> For the current list, I use Docsify!
