## [Pure](https://github.com/pure-css/pure/)

> A set of small, responsive CSS modules that you can use in every web project. https://purecss.io/

### CSS with a minimal footprint.
Pure is ridiculously tiny. The entire set of modules clocks in at 3.5KB* minified and gzipped. Crafted with mobile devices in mind, it was important to us to keep our file sizes small, and every line of CSS was carefully considered. If you decide to only use a subset of these modules, you'll save even more bytes.

### Your CSS foundation.
Pure builds on Normalize.css and provides layout and styling for native HTML elements, plus the most common UI components. It's what you need, without the cruft.

### Made with mobile in mind.
Pure is responsive out of the box, so elements look great on all screen sizes.

### Stays out of your way.
Pure has minimal styles and encourages you to write your application styles on top of it. It's designed to get out of your way and makes it easy to override styles.

```
<div class="pure-g">
    <div class="pure-u-1-3"><p>Thirds</p></div>
    <div class="pure-u-1-3"><p>Thirds</p></div>
    <div class="pure-u-1-3"><p>Thirds</p></div>
</div>
